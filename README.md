## Project Name

### Test Yourself

React.js Web Application for practicing with multiple topics quizzes.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. Users can Perform the four different topics quiz test and also see the correct answer. Functionality has been used to show correct or wrong messages toast based on user selection activity.
Another feature I have shown is the topics quiz data in a chart on the statistic page, and some blog posts have been shown on a Blog page.
